# Circle.c

General:

This is a program I wrote for a bit of fun a while ago in the C programming language. The intent of the program is to just display a circle, but as that goal is pretty straightforward and, well, boring: I'm not opposed to the overall end goal changing over time with contributions to the code or any ideas that I have for it. It may very well become 'Shape.c' for all I know.

Pull requests:

I'll happily accept commits to this project through pull requests if I find that they contribute something meaningful. If you commit optimisations or large scale change, a rough overview explaining your logic to the optimisation, or large scale change, while not strictly necessary, would be appreciated :)

Compilation:

Ensure that make is installed on your machine, execute make in the project directory, then run ./circle while providing it with parameters according to your circular desires.
